I am a post-doctoral fellow with the [Merck KGaA Global Health Institute](https://www.emdgroup.com/en/company/responsibility/our-strategy/health/mghi.html), performing research in the [Yoshino](https://www.vetmed.wisc.edu/people/yoshinot/) and [Zamanian](http://www.zamanianlab.org/) labs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I study vector-borne helminths like *Schistosoma mansoni* and *Brugia malayi*, both of which cause neglected tropical diseases. I received my PhD in Genetics and Genomics from Iowa State University, where I was advised by [Tim Day](https://vetmed.iastate.edu/users/day).
