abstract: "Parasitic nematodes (roundworms) and platyhelminths (flatworms) cause debilitating chronic infections of humans and animals, decimate crop production and are a major impediment to socioeconomic development. Here we report the broadest comparative study to date of the genomes of parasitic and non-parasitic worms, involving 81. We have identified gene family births and hundreds of expanded gene families at key nodes in the phylogeny that are relevant to parasitism. Examples include gene families that modulate host immune responses, enable parasite migration though host tissues or allow the parasite to feed. We reveal extensive lineage-specific differences in core metabolism and protein families historically targeted for drug development. From an *in silico* screen, we have identified and prioritised new potential drug targets and compounds for testing. This comparative genomics resource provides a much needed boost for the research community to understand and combat parasitic worms."
